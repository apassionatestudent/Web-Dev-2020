                <br/>
             <p>This is the Menu Section of my website. If there's something that you'd like, look at the predefined choices on the up-right corner. Fortunately, the Services and Help section is completely free under some conditions. If you need my help and service(coding) that's free, prove that you're worthy to be helped by me. The Visit and Support sections, on the other hand, is if you would like to support me or there's something you'd like to visit from the developer.</p>
                <br/>
             <p style="color: #ff1d00">Conditions:</p>
             <p><span class="important">☕</span> You need to be a hard-working person. If you're a damned lazy and rely on others greatly, then you can't have any of the things mentioned. I help those people who worked hard but can't easily get the topic. Not you who are lazy. I'm doing this for your own good. If you really want to learn, you'll work hard for it and won't be idle. In the industry, you'll likely be fired at a job because of being lazy and because you can't do the job well.</p>
                <br/>
             <p><span class="important">☕</span> You need to write your own code first before asking me on how to do some programming assignments, give ideas, or even I myself will create it for you(it depends upon the situation). The very thing you need to do is that, if bugs broke out or errors are apparent, I may help you only if you started your code first. I can probably sense that you're just writing code and not really trying to create a functional one. If so, it would mean that you're banned in getting free help and free services. I can't guarantee that I can help you if the assignment requires a specific language to be written which I don't currently have much acquaintance with.</p>
                <br/>
             <p><span class="important">☕</span> You need to chat my Facebook Page if you have something to talk of. I don't encourage you to chat me in private message. If you need to talk to me, then send a message on my Facebook Page which is available on the Contact Section. Otherwise I won't likely reply at your message sent on my account.</p>
                <br/>
             <p><span class="important">☕</span> You need to be grateful if you received one of the free things that I offer in this website. This is needed in my perspective. Ungrateful people aren't always welcome.</p>
                <br/>
             <p><span class="important">☕</span> This is optional. You need to like and follow on my Facebook Page. You don't need to give it a like and follow to get the free things that I offer. I do encourage you to do such, so I'll likely help you even more because you appreciate what I do for you aside from giving thanks in return.</p>
                <br/>
             <div id="congratulate">
                <br/>
             <p>If those four prerequisite conditions fits you, then I hereby qualify you to have the free stuffs that I offer here. Anyway, I may feel that you're fit or not so it would be accepted or canceled. </p>

                    <br/>
                <p>This website is created to test my skills in creating a website. This isn't mandated by a teacher to create this, it's my own will. It seems very successful at its first phase. Studying isn't enough for me, I must test my skills to see what I got from my studying, so I decided to come up with a project to do so. To gain some experience, I created this one. It's not complex or magnificent, it's just a simple mere website, simple beginnings of skills' improvement. I'm looking forward to update this in the future, if God willing. For now, it will be just a static website because I can't make it a dynamic website due to some reasons and especially this crap COVID-19.</p>

                    <br/>
                <p>As you can see my dear visitor, it's just a static website. I want to develop this even more but due some reasons wherein:</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">1. My second-hand computer doesn't have an internet access.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">2. This crap COVID-19 which prevents me going outside to gather the necessary things from internet cafes since my computer doesn't have an internet access. </p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">3. Limited access to the internet in my phone(for load). My cousin does have a WiFi but he doesn't want to let me connect into it.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">4. Limited cellphone usage(studying at my phone) due to its faulty charging mechanism. It takes the battery life abruptly as well. </p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">5. Phone's limited software and hardware capabilities. It can't install some applications which is needed for my hectic studying and its memory can't cope up with the data I need in studying. My phone is very old KitKat 4.4.1 and it's 6 years old since it was made. I'm just a poor man to buy one. Luckily, my father expressed his willingness to buy me a new one, but unfortunately due to this crap pandemic,  he can't. </p> 
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">6. Very noisy environment. My siblings create some damned noise which hinders me in focusing effectively. They're playing those damned musics, sound effects from Mobile Legends, and whatsoever damned noise they make is a complete hindrance! </p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">7. There are other problems as well that I should come up with better solutions.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p>Thus, I can't currently pursue for further improvements.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p>What I'm planning: </p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">1. To make an administrator's section. </p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">2. To be able this website through the administrator section, update, delete and create the contents herein without dealing with the source code.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">3. To create a database and connect it into this.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">4. To be able this website to post some contents(like the ones at Facebook) in the About/General section.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p>I may add up some plans if God willing.</p>
            </div>
             
            <div class="aboutDiv">
                <p class="aboutDivTtle">Delayed Project</p>
                    <br/>
                <p class="impAbout">This project started on October 24, 2019. It's the early stage of development. But due to some factors, it's delayed for months.</p>
                    <br/> 
                <p>Since it started at late October 2019, it's under the 2nd semester of Grade 11. So therefore, there's a lot of projects to deal with from minor subjects with some literally deadly deadlines for my grades. I had two subjects for research, I needed to create a video, and so on. There are literally many projects which I needed to comply if I wanted to pass Grade 11. This fact hindered me to continue the project and to study about technology.</p>
                     <br/>
                <p>At December 6, 2019, my computer became faulty. I initially thought that it was just the CMOS since the monitor worked but the system unit didn't. So I replaced it with a new one but it didn't still worked. It perplexed me somehow thinking about what's the problem. Then I finally figured out that it was the power supply's fault!. It's replaced with a new one at March 2020.</p>
                    <br/>
                <p>It works! But due to an space issue(its former placement was blocked by a storage box), so I didn't set up the computer and it was just on the other side. On early May 2020, the box was removed and I finally set up computer into it. The computer is set up and I continued finishing this at early June. </p>

I want to learn more because I realized the broadness and complexity of modern technology. By having the right knowledge, I might help other people by making their daily lives more easy through the proper usage of modern technology.</p>

                <p>There's a lot of things I want to achieve, like understanding something complex. To do so, I put a lot of effort and dedication to achieve so. Besides, when there's something I'd like to build like this website for example, I sat on a chair facing the computer for hours especially when bugs are apparent. I work hard on studying as well. I don't actually put a lot of time on studying about technology on school days because there's a lot of minor subjects that often taking a lot of time. I've started studying on February 2019. Since then, I learned a lot of things. </p>

                <p> <span class="important">Eat ♨, Study ✍, Sleep ≐, Repeat ↺</span> <br/> I can't easily achieve something without working for it seriously. Dedication and effort is a must! There's must be no room for laziness. Of course, I take rest when I'm tired. I won't like to push myself beyond, so I take a rest. Besides, while I'm taking  a rest, I often watch videos to gather more insights so no time would be wasted for nothing. Then, I get back to where I left. I studied(February 2019, 16 years old and college is near if God willing) very lately which means, I need to cope up with time. Full-scale rest can take place sometimes wherein I literally waste time.</p>

I don't want to put myself at a brink of surrender, I have courage to continue no matter how hard and how it put a lot of pressure on my brain. Fortunately most of the time, I fixed those bugs through focus, determination and effort. The best thing with this is, I learned from my mistakes and hereby improve my skills as I solved those bugs. </p>

See and inspire the examples of glorious deeds. Forget not, the reward ahead. Thus, should never be fallen.</p>

                <p><span class="important">Brief Overview of Being Sleepy <sup>z z z z</sup></span> <br/> As we're awake doing the daily stuffs that we do, our bodies breaking down <abbr title="Adenosine Triphosphate">ATP</abbr> <span class="abbr">Adenosine Triphosphate</span> which results to adenosine, a by-product of <abbr title="Adenosine Triphosphate">ATP</abbr> <span class="abbr">Adenosine Triphosphate</span>. These adenosine will go to adenosine receptors and that's what will make us drowsy, tired, etc. in short, to be sleepy. The more adenosine, the more drowsy can we potentially be. This fact can potentially hinders us to study well because we can't focus sharply due to the tiredness we feel. If we can't study well, then we might not learn new things depending upon what topic we're studying of. </p>

                <p><span class="important">Brief Overview on How Caffeine Works ☕ </span> <br/> Caffeine and adenosine are more or less similar in structure. This fact makes Caffeine to be the best impostor of adenosine! By being so, Caffeine goes to the adenosine receptors in our body and blocking any adenosine to come into. adenosine makes us tired, Caffeine is otherwise. Caffeine is simply the contradiction of tiredness. This will make us feel alert, fast heartbeats, energetic, etc. Coffee can help us in our studies and I'm drinking coffee for that very purpose. Now some of you might be nervous in drinking even just 1mL of coffee due to some rumors about it. The rumors about coffee are just rumors and unproven. Besides, there's also called the Nocebo Effect which makes us feel sicker due to our beliefs that something is harmful. I won't explain much about it and I encourage you to study about it to have more acquaintance. Although Caffeine can be harmful, only on large doses(depending upon body weight) a day. So grab a cup of coffee and drink, then enjoy studying! ;) </p>

            <p style="text-align: center">This thing is the first of all. I'm passionate to learn and I'm curious about the things around me. By being so, I study a lot about the things that I'd like to learn of. This habit is most frequent one that I do.</p> 
            </div>
                <br/>
            <p>I'm studying to learn something:</p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forStudy">Information Technology</span> <br/> This is can be referred to front-end web development, programming, computer hardware and anything that's related to this field. This field is the forefront of my studies as I want to take this course on college if God willing. Besides, I want to be a successful programmer someday if God willing. </p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forStudy">Science</span> <br/>
            We know that there are many branches in Science. There are Physics, Microbiology, Exobiology, Botany, Biology, etc. just to name a few. In nature, Science is always involved. Studying Science means having an awareness about the nature of this earth.</p> <br/>
            <p>Well I study these branches and I'll explain why:         <br/> 
            <p class="branchSci" title="Physics">Physics</p>
            <p class="branchSciShow">I love to understand how physical objects behave. I may use this knowledge eventually like creating something. Having a grasp at this is very crucial in a way you won't comprehend easily.</p> 
                <br/>
            <p class="branchSci" title="Microbiology"> Microbiology </p>
            <p class="branchSciShow">We know that microbes or pathogens exist like bacterias, viruses, parasites, etc. Some of them can be fatal when inside your body. The best example is <span class="aboutWarnings">COVID-19</span> which can potentially kill you. Having a glimpse in Microbiology means having an awareness about the dangers of these dangerous(not all microbes) tiny creatures. So I won't easily do the things that can get microbes like walking barefoot, eating without washing my hands, etc. due to the awareness of these tiny creatures. Thus, I protect myself by the preventative measures that I know about.</p>
                <br/>
            <p class="branchSci" title="Human Anatomy">Anatomy</p>
            <p class="branchSciShow">I'd like to understand how our certain body parts work and how to keep them healthy. It's good to know the weak parts and strong parts of each organ.</p>
                <br/>
            <p>These three aren't the only ones that I'm studying of.</p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forStudy">Linguistics</span> <br/> 
            To be able to communicate with a lot of people is a crucial thing, no matter their races may be. I selected some languages to be studied. <br/> <br/>
            I'll explain why I study these languages. </p>
            
            <p class="linguisticClick" title="German" id="german"><span id="lc1">German</span> <span id="deutsch">Deutsch Sprache</span></p>
            <p class="linguisticShow">The thing that I love with this language is its accent. When Germans speak to each other, the sound is very lovely to me. That's why I study this language. </p> <br/>
            
            <p class="linguisticClick" title="Portuguese" id="portugueS" class="lcs"><span id="lc2">Portuguese</span> <span id="portugues">O língua de Português</span></p>
            <p class="linguisticShow">Well, I study this language in a particular confidential reason. I want to learn this because I want to communicate with some specific people. Anyway, it's spoken in Brazil and Portugal making it good to learn of, so I'll speak to a lot of people if I learned it.</p> <br/>
            
            <p class="linguisticClick" title="Russian" id="russian"><span id="lc3">Russian</span> <span id="russiaN">Русский Язык</span></p>  
            <p class="linguisticShow"> Russian language is a Slavic language. I study this one because their songs are cool. Furthermore, this language are spoken to other post-Soviet states which means I can speak to some people outside of Russia if I learned it.</p> <br/>
            
            <p class="linguisticClick" title="Spanish" id="spanish"><span id="lc4">Spanish</span> <span id="espanol">La idioma de español</span></p>  
            <p class="linguisticShow">First of all, I have a long old distant Spanish blood on my mother's side. As a respect to my distant Spanish ancestors, I study Spanish. Furthermore, it's spoken in some parts of Latin America and in Spain so it will give me an advantage to talk to a lot of people. </p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forStudy">Military Tactics</span> <br/> Sounds weird though but I actually study such matter. The world is full of potential threats and I should know how to defend myself in times of aggression and terrorism. I even analyze some military equipments, train myself to be be physically fit, etc. about military tactics. The cool part of this is focus under pressure which is applied especially during combat. This one can probably be used at studying in stressful environments. </p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forStudy">History</span> <br/> 
            Maybe it's not really needed but I give importance to history so I include it in my studies. I chiefly study about historical wars, various civilizations, magnificent ancient infrastructures, etc. Some of the architecture ingenuity of some ancient civilizations are mesmerizing to look at, even though they didn't had modern equipments, they were capable of building something magnificent! By watching documentaries regarding to this, I can have insights on how they did so and how clever they were. That's what make history somehow awesome!</p>

                <br/>
            <p style="text-align: center"> I love coffee because it helps me to a lot of aspects. I often drink coffee like once a day to better cope up to everything that I'm doing.</p>    
            </div>
                <br/>
            <p>Drinking coffee ☕ with its finest reasons:</p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forCoffee">Coffee for Energy</span> <br/> Coffee doesn't actually give me energy as others may have initially thought, what it does is to make me feel more energize by getting rid of adenosine and replacing with caffeine to feel energize, faster heart beats, etc. to actively do what I want.</p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forCoffee">Its Aroma</span> <br/> I love the savory aroma of coffee which makes me feel better. Aromas of coffees may vary upon every products but they have one aroma in common because they came from coffee beans.</p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forCoffee">Its Taste</span> <br/> I love the taste of coffee regardless of its bitterness like Nescafe Stick for example. Various tastes can be found as well depending to those who manufactured the finish products but they also have in common because they came from coffee beans. There are sugary coffees and I prefer the pure ones. </p>

            <p><span class="forPre">To Protect</span> <br/> I know that there's a lot of instances that my life would be at risk by other people who's dangerous to deal with. I'm preparing my body in its aspects to defend myself against potential treats like making my body stronger, learning how to deal with them in case of a fierce fighting. </p>
                <br/>
            <p><span class="forPre">To Defend</span> <br/> I saw some horrible incidents depicted in SOCO, Imbestigador, etc. which are based on real-life events. I feel wrath when seeing such and wishing that I could defend them. I may probably witness such horrible events in front of me and I should be ready to defend such. </p>

                    <p>I pursue to understand technology of our modern world. I strive hard studying to do so. Before February 2019 which is the month I started studying, I had no plans on what I was doing to do for the future if God willing. Then someone went to our school lecturing about Information Technology and I was convinced about such matter. I realized that it's very important to study about modern technology. Since then, I've started studying and it seems that it's all worth it. </p>
                    
                        <br/>

                    <p>Sometimes, I forgot some important topics so I need to review it again to increase the synapses of my neurons so that it won't be easily forgotten.

                    <p>I like socializing to a lot of people, especially for those people that have the same interests as I am. By having such interest, I'm studying some languages. Anyway, it looks cool when I can speak with many languages. It seems an advantage for me as well, not only in socialization, but also in communication. ;) </p>
                        <br/>
                    <p>Tagalog, Visayan and English languages are emphasized because I'm capable of making a conversation with these languages. The Spanish, Portuguese, German and Russian languages aren't emphasized because I'm still studying these languages. I'm improving in Spanish and I'm capable of a small Spanish conversation with natives. I'm studying with the help of Facebook groups(for learning Russian, German, Spanish and Portuguese), YouTube channels(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/russianpod101" target="_blank">RussianPod 101</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Germanpod101" target="_blank">GermanPod 101</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/spanishpod101" target="_blank">SpanishPod 101</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/portuguesepod101" target="_blank">PortuguesePod 101</a> and others), apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ascendo.android.dictionary.de.free" target="_blank">English-German Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ascendo.android.dictionary.es.free" target="_blank">English-Spanish Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ascendo.android.dictionary.pt.free" target="_blank">English-Portuguese Dictionary</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ufo.disease" target="_blank">Diseases Dictionary Free</a>(they have Russian, German, Spanish, Portuguese translations that I can look into for gathering words and look for its definitions), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ParaLightWorX" target="_blank">ParaLight WorX</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Langfocus" target="_blank">Langfocus</a> and others.</p>

                    <p>I'm looking forward to study other languages as well if I master somehow the languages mentioned in Others section of this Linguistic Skills, if God willing. It can be Chinese(more preferable, even just the basics and not the whole complexity), Japanese, Korean, etc. For now, I'm still improving and studying about the languages mentioned in the Others section.</p>

                        <br/>
                    <p>I like studying Science because it has a lot of real-life applications. This interest can lead for me to be a scientist but I opt to learn technology more because I have huge interest in technology. I encourage you to study about Science whatever the fields that you'll choose aside from studying about technology if you're an IT/CS, or whatsoever the course that you're taking in, study Science :) .</p>
                        <br/>
                    <p>I don't put a lot of time studying about Science compared to the time that I'm studying about technology. I watch some videos regarding about Science especially from these YouTube channels: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SciShow" target="_blank">SciShow</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/scishowspace" target="_blank">SciShow Space</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SciShowPsych" target="_blank">SciShow Psych</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/teded" target="_blank">TED-Ed</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BRIGHTSIDEOFFICIAL" target="_blank">BRIGHT SIDE</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ScienceTime24" target="_blank">Science Time</a> and from other YouTube channels that have science-related contents. </p>
                        <br/>
                    <p>There are other branches that are not mentioned. I study on what I'm interested in. If I'm interested in an specific field, then I'll study even just the basics, and so on. I'm not saying that I'm very good at those branches, but I do posses somehow the fundamental knowledge about those branches. I want to improve my scientific skills if God willing, but my focus is more about technology.</p>

                        <p>I marvel at the beauty of space. But let's be honest, some parts of the universe are hostile to go into. Anyway, it's good to see how beautiful the things that God created in the universe. How much more if I understand some parts of it? Completely a good thing! If an atheist is reading this, don't convince me that God doesn't exist because I believe in the existence of God. Just keep your beliefs there and I'll keep mine over here. <span style="color: #8b2b00; font-size: 1.25em">⚑</span> Well, if you insist in your disbelief then I'm open for a scientific debate to prove the existence of God.</p>

        I'm sorry if you don't like my repetitions about, "...if God willing...". It's just a matter of my spiritual belief. I'll provide a detailed explanation why I often said so. If you're an atheist, then don't mind it.

        Kawikaan 27:1 (TAB)
            Huwag mong ipaghambog ang kinabukasan; Sapagkat hindi mo nalalaman kung ano ang ilalabas ng ibang araw.

        Santiago 4:13-15 (TAB)
            Magsiparito ngayon, kayong nagsisipagsabi, Ngayon o bukas ay magsisiparoon kami sa gayong bayan, at titira kami doong isang taon, at mangangalakal, at magtutubo:
            Kayo ngang hindi nakakaalam ng mangyayari bukas. Ano ang inyong buhay? Kayo nga'y isang singaw na sa sangdaling panahon ay lumilitaw, at pagdaka'y napapawi.
            Sapagka't and dapat ninyong sabihin ay, Kung loloobin ng Panginoon ay mangabubuhay kami, at gagawin namit ito o yaon.

        As stated in those verses whenever we say about the future like planning, as a Christian it's not good to say about it like I know everything; so therefore, it should be accompanied by: if God willing. Look at the verse James 4:15 that says so. I'm not sure what's going at the future so I better use such words. Any future plans depict such phrase regardless if it's not written therein. If you're an atheist, don't mind this one. I believe in the existence of God. If you insist in yours, well I'm open(if I'm not busy) for a scientific debate to prove His existence.
        

        I would like to know more people who are passionate about technology and collaborate with them, to improve and prepare ourselves for the industry ahead, if God willing.

        I would like to improve this mere project from static to dynamic, if God willing.
